## <a id="native-mac-games"></a>Native Mac Games

Native Mac ports are, most of the time, the best way to enjoy a game on your Mac. These can be purchased on the Mac App Store (some exclusively), some others are only available with an Apple Arcade subscription. The Mac App Store sometimes offers Universal Purchase, which means you can play the game on every supported Apple platform for a single fee. Other online stores offer Mac games, such as [GOG](https://www.gog.com/), the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/), and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Unlike the other stores, GOG provides games without DRM. The Epic Games Store is also notable for offering free games each Thursday, although Mac games are quite rare (many games that offer a Mac version are only available for Windows on the Epic Games Store). Note that the Epic Games Launcher will launch Universal Binary games as Intel processes on Apple Silicon Macs, you can launch games from the Epic Games Store as Apple Silicon processes with [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/). The store with the largest game selection by far is Steam. When you buy a game on GOG, the Epic Games Store or Steam, you also get a license for the Windows version, and Linux version when available.

### <a id="steams-handling-of-32-bit-mac-games"></a>Steam's Handling of 32-bit Mac Games

When Apple decided to drop 32-bit support with macOS Catalina, many Mac games became non-functional overnight. The games could still be played provided you didn't update macOS but since Steam eventually also dropped support for 32-bit on macOS, there is no way to run these games natively on macOS anymore.

Valve decided to make developers manually specify if their game was 64-bit in the SteamWorks database, making games 32-bit by default. Games assumed to be 32-bit are signaled as incompatible with macOS Catalina and newer on the game's page. They are also signaled in the game library by an icon (ðŸš«) next to their name and a message on their description page. These games are filtered out when clicking on the Apple logo to filter the Mac-only games. Unfortunately, many 64-bit games are incorrectly assumed to be 32-bit. Some of them are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DkOsI9AwAT4dzPkLmunYJJmUpf1FuWR62Q1vAEfJzM/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, games that were delisted from the store are all reported as 64-bit in the library, whether the database says so or not.

## <a id="dual-booting"></a>Dual Booting

Intel-based Macs can boot on Windows like any other PC thanks to [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/us-en/guide/bootcamp-control-panel/bcmp29b8ac66/mac). This will run any Windows game. Apple Silicon-based Macs cannot boot under Windows, but while Apple said it was open to making Boot Camp available for Apple Silicon-based Macs to run Windows for Arm, they said it only depended on Microsoft's approval.

## <a id="ios-versions"></a>iOS Versions

Some Windows games have also been released for iPhone and iPad, and those apps can technically run on Apple Silicon-based Macs when allowed by their publishers on the App Store, which is arguably the closest thing to a native macOS version. However, many games are simply not allowed to run. There is a workaround for this with [PlayCover](https://playcover.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), which are free apps that allow sideloading and running decrypted iOS/iPadOS apps on Apple Silicon-based Macs.

## <a id="translation-layers"></a>Translation Layers

These apps will translate Windows API calls to macOS API calls on the fly. While this solution doesn't make every Windows game work flawlessly (most notably, games with anti-cheat protection won't run), it's usually the best option to try first. These are all derived from Wine, and do not run Windows itself. There are several interfaces to translate various versions of [DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX) (Windows' graphical API) to [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)) (macOS' graphical API), such as [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) (which translates DirectX 8/9/10/11 to Vulkan, which in turn is translated to Metal with [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)), [WineD3D](https://fdossena.com/?p=wined3d/index.frag) (DirectX 1-11 to OpenGL), or [DXMT](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt) (DirectX 11 to Metal). In 2021, Apple released [Game Porting Toolkit](https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/), which includes D3DMetal, an interface for Wine and its derivatives that translates DirectX 12 to Metal, bringing improved speed and compatibility to software layer translation.

- [CodeWeavers CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/) (paid)
- [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/) (free and open source)
- [Kegworks](https://github.com/Kegworks-App/Kegworks) (successor of Wineskin, turns Windows games into macOS apps, free and open source)
- [Porting Kit](https://www.portingkit.com/) (turns Windows games into macOS apps, free)
- [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) (command-line interface only, free and open source)

Note that CrossOver usually offers the best compatibility and most up-to-date versions of Wine and the various DirectX translation interfaces. Codeweavers is also the biggest contributor to the Wine project, so supporting them helps everyone. CrossOver also comes with CrossTies, a list of game-specific fixes and workarounds for games that don't run out of the box through Wine, but starting with CrossOver 25 this will be phased out due to a better general compatibility. A common misconception about CrossOver is that the fee only allows you to use it for a year, whereas in reality you can use it forever, but you only get a year's worth of free updates. [CXPatcher](https://github.com/italomandara/CXPatcher) is a non-official tool that allows updating CrossOver's dependencies.

If you want to know if a specific game runs, there are compatibility lists:
- [for CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/#compatibility)
- [for Whisky](https://docs.getwhisky.app/game-support/index.html)
- [for Porting Kit](https://www.portingkit.com/games)

Sometimes, the Windows version of specific store launchers (GOG Galaxy, Epic Games Launcher, Amazon Games) can get updates which breaks support with the above software translation layers. A workaround is to use [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/), a native launcher for Windows and Mac games for these stores.

## <a id="virtualization"></a>Virtualization

Virtualization is different from emulation, in that it runs the native code on the host processor, when they share the same instruction set. The processor is shared between the two environments at once. For instance, a Nintendo Switch runs on an Arm processor, and thus can be virtualized on an Apple Silicon-based Mac. While there is an overhead compared to running a game on its original platform since the hardware is shared with macOS, it's generally faster than emulation as it converts one instruction set to the other. Unlike translation layers, these will run and require installing complete operating systems (like Windows or Linux), and unlike translation layers are usually more general-purpose than focused on gaming.

- [UTM](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817) (free)

## <a id="windows-games-available-on-other-platforms"></a>Windows Games Available on Other Platforms

These games can be run either through emulation or virtualization depending on the processor of the platform it runs on. There are countless emulators available for macOS, supporting from the most famous to the most obscure platforms, so this list won't be exhaustive and will only feature the most prominent emulators. Some Windows games were also released on these platforms (or inversely, some games first released on older platforms were eventually released on Steam through emulation), which provides an alternative, and sometimes superior, way of playing them on macOS. Some emulators provide improvements to how the original games ran, for instance by increasing their resolution, or even supporting bespoke HD graphical packs, effectively offering a "remastered" experience.

## <a id="cloud-gaming"></a>Cloud Gaming

Cloud gaming runs games on a remote PC and streams the video output to your Mac in real-time, while your Mac just displays the video stream and sends controller inputs to the server. It requires a good internet connection, but it can sometimes be the only solution for specific games. Note that most of these only support a limited selection of games and require monthly payments.
